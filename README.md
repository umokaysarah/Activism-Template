# Make your own website- no coding necessary!

Seeing the massive influx of information and resources over social media as the BLM movement has gained momentum inspired me to make this website template.

I created this so that anyone who had resources to share could do so efficiently. Doesn't matter what your cause is- Black Lives Matter, saving the turtles, womens rights, etc, any information you have so that people can educate themselves and get involved can be easily organized in this website. 

## Creating a website with this template involves only 3 steps:
1. Download the template code onto your computer
2. Input any information you want to include
3. Build and deploy your website

If it still seems scary- reach out to me anytime via email or instagram. I can help you through the process or even do it for you - all I need is the resources you want included. 

## Step by Step instructions

### Download the template

Downloading is easy through github. If you don't know anything about gitHub, I suggest simply downloading the zip file as shown below. 
If you do know github- feel free to clone or download the files how you want. 

Then unzip the file in a convient place on your computer (like the desktop or a dedicated folder)

### Input your resources

You'll want to have some sort of text editor for this part. A good simple one would be [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/). I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Open the template in your desired text editor.
